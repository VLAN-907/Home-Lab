DNS issues
not resolving to open dns servers - sort of.  nslookup giving local gateway 192.168.1.1.  But opendns stats show a lot of traffic.  Do I need to be concerned with this?


dns unbound, for local lookups
opendns for external and also filter.  Turned on filter for adult sites and illegal activities


-for this create a config or setup section

-also creat a section that talks about specific issues that I ran into

-and reference resources
