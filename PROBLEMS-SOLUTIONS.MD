Ran into an issue where I changed one of the Vlans to a /27 to reduce it's footprint.  Somehow it had already handed out an ip in the full /24 range.  When I reduce the number of aviailable hosts on that subnet, it caused the dhcp service to crash for all of opnsense.  This made me consider that I don't care for that particular instability. That in adittion for a desire to learn and grow in my cisco skills led me to consider purchasing a cisco router.
