# Home Network Lab Documentation

Welcome to my personal network lab project! This repository documents the design, configuration, and ongoing development of my home network and lab environment. The goal is to improve my skills in network engineering, firewall management, VLAN segmentation, VPN configuration, and infrastructure documentation — while building a secure, segmented, and scalable network at home.

## Overview  

This lab uses **OPNsense** as the core firewall/router with VLAN segmentation, **Pi-hole** for ad-blocking and DNS filtering, **OpenDNS** for DNS security, and various hardware components like managed switches and wireless access points.  

The lab is designed to simulate small-to-mid-sized network environments while providing a secure and scalable infrastructure for real-world use and future experimentation.

## Webtrees Self-Hosted Genealogy Platform

# Webtrees Self-Hosted Genealogy Platform

## Project Summary
This project documents my deployment and configuration of [Webtrees](https://webtrees.net/), an open-source, self-hosted genealogy application for managing and exploring family trees. The goal is to maintain full control over personal family history data while building hands-on experience with Linux server administration, LAMP stack management, and secure web hosting practices.

---

## Key Features
- Self-hosted on **Ubuntu Server** within my home lab environment
- Full **LAMP stack** deployment (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP)
- Secured with **Let's Encrypt SSL** for encrypted HTTPS access
- Automated **database and media backups**
- Fully private setup — no reliance on third-party genealogy platforms

---

## Why This Project?
- Provides a **private, customizable platform** for family history research
- Strengthens my skills in:
  - Web server administration (**Apache2**)
  - Database management (**MySQL/MariaDB**)
  - Linux security, backups, and system automation
- Supports long-term **digital preservation** of family records

---

## Future Plans
- Evaluate **Docker-based deployment** for easier portability
- Integrate with existing **home network services** (DNS, backup systems)
- Potential public-facing deployment with a domain and secure remote access

---

## Related Technologies
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
- Apache2
- MySQL or MariaDB
- PHP 8.x
- Let's Encrypt (Certbot)
- Webtrees 2.x

---

*This project reflects my ongoing efforts to build a secure, private, and reliable platform for family tree management while developing practical system administration skills in my home lab.*
