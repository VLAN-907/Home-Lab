# UniFi Controller Setup & VLAN-Tagged SSIDs

## Date
2025-07-23

## Objective
Set up a UniFi controller in Proxmox to manage a UniFi AP, adopt it into the network, and prepare to segment wireless traffic using VLANs per SSID.

---

## Steps Completed

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Deploy UniFi Controller in Proxmox
- Created a new LXC container in Proxmox.
- Set `features: nesting=1` and enabled `usePAM: yes` for full functionality.
- Installed UniFi Network Application using [LinuxServer.io Docker container](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-unifi-controller).
- Mapped required ports (e.g., 8443 for GUI).
- Ensured container had static IP and proper DNS resolution.

### üîê 2. Access Controller GUI
- Accessed the UniFi controller via: `https://<container-IP>:8443`
- Logged in and completed initial setup wizard.

### üì° 3. Adopt UniFi Access Point (AP)
- AP discovered via Layer 2.
- Adopted AP through controller dashboard.
- Waited for it to fully provision and update firmware (if needed).
- Confirmed successful connection to controller.

### üöö 4. Move AP to Final Location
- Physically unplugged the AP and moved it to desired location.
- Plugged into a trunk port allowing all necessary VLANs.

### üåê 5. Configure VLANs for SSIDs
- Navigated to **Settings > Networks**
- Selected **"Add New Virtual Network"**
- Created VLAN-only networks for each desired segment:
  - Example: `IoT VLAN` (VLAN ID: 20)
  - Example: `Guest VLAN` (VLAN ID: 30)
- Saved each virtual network without DHCP or routing (handled by external router).

---

## Next Steps
- Assign VLANs to specific SSIDs via **Settings > WiFi > SSID > Advanced > Use VLAN**
- Confirm switch ports and upstream router (e.g., OPNsense) are correctly tagging and handling VLANs
- Apply firewall rules as needed in router to isolate VLANs

## Notes
- Ensure controller container‚Äôs time, DNS, and internet connectivity are solid
- Future plan: integrate controller with Home Assistant and Zabbix for visibility
