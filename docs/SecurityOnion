## 🌐 Network Architecture

| Role              | Details                                    |

| Management NIC    | `ens18` – static IP on management VLAN / LAN |
| Sniffer NIC       | `ens19` – attached to switch SPAN/mirror port, no IP, listens in promiscuous mode |
| Switch Setup      | TP-Link T1600G-28PS with port mirroring configured, feeding mirrored LAN traffic to Proxmox host NIC |
| Virtualization    | Proxmox VM, 2 NICs (management + sniffer), bridge config: `vmbr0` (LAN), `vmbr1` (mirror) |

🛠️ Custom Lab Notes
Switch mirroring configured on TP-Link T1600G-28PS.

Proxmox NIC attached to mirror port receives live LAN traffic.

Sniffer NIC (ens19) explicitly configured with:

ini
Copy
Edit
BOOTPROTO=none
IPV6INIT=no
ONBOOT=yes
Successfully disabled IPv6 to prevent setup conflicts.

✅ Next Steps
Test rule triggers with lab-generated traffic (e.g., nmap scan, basic attacks).

Update Suricata and Zeek signatures.

Tune alert thresholds and notifications.

Expand with Wazuh or Elastic Agent for endpoint monitoring.

📅 Date of Setup
Completed: 2025-05-08

🚀 Notes
This setup marks a major milestone in building out my home lab for network security monitoring, intrusion detection, and hands-on defensive security practice using enterprise-grade open-source tools.
