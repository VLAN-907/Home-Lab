# Future Home Network Stack Plans

##  Hardware
- Integrate Ubiquiti or Cisco enterprise APs  
- Add a managed Cisco switch  
- Possibly replace OPNsense router with Cisco ISR (C1100 or C1111 series)  
- Expand server infrastructure (Proxmox cluster or additional lab servers)

##  Network Monitoring & SIEM
- Implement network monitoring tools (Zabbix, LibreNMS)
- Set up Grafana dashboards for visual metrics
- Deploy Security Onion for centralized SIEM and intrusion detection  

##  Security & Key Management
- Integrate a free, open-source key management system (HashiCorp Vault or alternatives)
- Plan for centralized key management for VPNs, services, and secrets  

##  Documentation & Knowledge Management
- Maintain full Home Network Lab Documentation on GitHub (network diagrams, configs, decisions)
- Possibly mirror or sync documentation in Obsidian for local offline notes

##  Virtualization & Lab Environment
- Run GNS3 for virtual network simulation and Cisco image testing  
- Create dedicated VM for GNS3 server instead of running locally on a laptop  

##  DNS & Filtering  
- Integrate Pi-hole for DNS filtering  
- Decide whether to replace or integrate alongside Unbound and OpenDNS  

## VPN & Remote Access  
- Finalize WireGuard setup for secure VPN access  
- Explore automating key generation and distribution for VPN clients  

##  Future Configuration Tasks
- Create VLAN 99 as the default untagged management VLAN  
- Build out additional VLANs for IoT, Guests, Servers, and Security Onion  
- Review DHCP server scopes and resilience plans  
- Set up scheduled configuration backups for OPNsense  
- Investigate firmware auto-update options for OPNsense or Cisco gear  

#  Home Network Lab Documentation Outline

## 1. Project Overview
- Purpose: Learning, security hardening, career development  
- Key technologies and tools  

## 2. Network Topology
- Network diagram  
- VLAN list, IDs, purposes, subnets  
- Rationale for segmentation  

## 3. Hardware Inventory
- Firewalls, switches, APs, servers, IoT, media servers  

## 4. Services & Software Stack
- Firewall config, VLAN setup, rules summary  
- DNS (Unbound, OpenDNS, Pi-hole)  
- VPN (WireGuard)  
- SIEM (Security Onion)  
- Metrics & monitoring (Grafana, Zabbix, LibreNMS)  - Granfana is set up.  Need to finish documentation. 
- Media services (Jellyfin) - This is set up.  Need to complete documentation.
- Install Next Cloud in my environment and evaulate moving away from Office 365 for family needs: https://nextcloud.com/
- Home Assistant: https://www.home-assistant.io/
- Host family Ancestry software: webtrees: https://webtrees.net/ ; possible needs:
  - Linux server with Apache or Nginx
