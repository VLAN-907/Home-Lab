# Proxmox Cluster Setup Guide

## Overview

This document describes the steps I followed to set up a Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) cluster with two nodes in my home lab. The cluster allows centralized management, VM/container migration, and (optionally) ZFS replication or high availability (HA).

---

## Hardware

- **Node 1**: Main Proxmox server (hostname: `proxmox`, IP: `192.168.1.135`)
- **Node 2**: Second Proxmox server (hostname: `pve2`, IP: `192.168.1.201`)

Both nodes have static IPs and are connected to the same local LAN.

---

## Installation Steps

### 1️⃣ Install Proxmox VE on Both Nodes

- Download latest ISO from [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads).
- Flash to USB (e.g., using balenaEtcher or Rufus).
- Boot each machine and install Proxmox on local disk.
- Assign static IP, unique hostname, and set up root password.

### 2️⃣ Prepare First Node (Cluster Creator)

On the first node:

```bash
pvecm create HomeLab --bindnet0_addr 192.168.1.135
```
- `HomeLab` is the cluster name.
- `--bindnet0_addr` specifies which interface/IP to use.

Check cluster status:

```bash
pvecm status
```

If needed (single-node cluster):
```bash
pvecm expected 1
```

### 3️⃣ Prepare Second Node (Joining)

On the second node, **clean up any previous failed join**:

```bash
systemctl stop pve-cluster corosync
umount -l /etc/pve || true
rm -rf /etc/pve/nodes/*
rm -rf /etc/corosync/*
rm -rf /var/lib/corosync/*
rm -f /var/lib/pve-cluster/config.db*
reboot
```

### 4️⃣ Join Cluster

After reboot, on the second node:

```bash
pvecm add 192.168.1.135 --force
```

This connects to the first node using its IP. The `--force` skips SSL hostname verification (fine for home lab).

### 5️⃣ Verify Cluster

On either node:

```bash
pvecm status
```

Expected output:

- `Nodes: 2`
- `Quorate: Yes`
- Membership showing both nodes

Check the web interface (`https://<node-ip>:8006`) — both nodes should appear under **Datacenter**.

---

## Notes

- Without shared storage, live migration will require local disk copies.
- ZFS replication can provide periodic syncing between nodes.
- Two-node clusters are fragile for quorum — consider adding a **qdevice** or third node for HA setups.

---

## Future Work

- Set up ZFS replication.
- Explore adding a quorum device or third Proxmox node.
- Test live VM/container migration.
